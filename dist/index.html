      <h3>Our Achievements </h3>
      <p>
          We have fabricated over 430 energy saving stoves (Steel215 and Clay215).
  The Company has a nursery bed of tree seedlings and a main garden of 1 acre where they have planted. We are looking for possible ways of increasing this project because it benefits the environment more. 
  We have managed to open up offices in Kampala and Kihihi where we operate from

			<h3>A Better Life For Every One</h3>
			<p>The project will benefit 3,000,000 female and 2,000,000 male Ugandans. This is the design planned because the project desires to respond to the financial needs of females owing to the fact they struggle more to get financial empowerment compared to males. They must be 18-55years of age and in marriage or single mother or single fathers with a certain level of responsibility that enables the target beneficiary to benefit more people in the household. They should be having the desire to raise income from energy saving stove enterprises or ready to reduce use of charcoal or wood. This will work best for households living in areas with little firewood</p>

				<h3>Our Target</h3>
			<p>Our Strategic Objective is to have at least 10,000 Ugandan households supportedwith energy saving stoves by December 2022.</p>

        <h3>OUTCOMES </h3>
      <p>At the end of the Project, we shall have at least 5,000,000 Ugandans trained in energy saving technologies, among which100,000 households will be having energy saving stoves constructed for them, 10,000 joined the company as shareholders. The company expects to install more 2,000,000 stoves in various homes at a profit to benefit more Ugandans who are able to buy and install stoves</p>
